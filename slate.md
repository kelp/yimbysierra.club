# The YIMBY Party Slate for the Sierra Club San Francisco Group 2016 Executive Commitee Election.

## Armand Domalewski

## Travis Cole

Travis grew up in the woods of North Central Washington State, but has
had family in the Bay Area going back 4 generations. In summer, he can
often be found in various California state parks, and snowboarding Tahoe
in winter. He's worked in the technology industry for over 16 year
and if elected, would bring many years of management experience, and
a broad IT background to the Sierra Club. Besides the Sierra Club, he's
also a member of the EFF, ACLU, and the SF Bike Coalition.
