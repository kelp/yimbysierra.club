# The YIMBY Party Slate for the Sierra Club San Francisco Group 2016 Executive Commitee Election.

## Armand Domalewski

Armand enjoys long walks on the beach, pina coladas, and
solving existential climate change. He's been obsessed with
environmentally friendly transit solutions since he was a small child,
nagging his parents to take him to BART stations so he could watch the
trains whiz by. He pursued this passion for environmental justice at
Novogradac and Company, working as an economic analyst specializing in
renewable energy tax credit policy. He published reports and analyses
advocating for expansions of critical funding sources for
environmentally sound forms of energy. He provided critical support at
New Media Ventures, a nonprofit that allocated funding to progressive
media and technology startups such as the Story of Stuff and the Daily
Kos. Armand's current work focuses on community organizing and housing
advocacy, with a major emphasis on the role of dense infill housing in
reducing carbon emissions.

## Travis Cole

Travis has a passion for conservation, the outdoors, and urbanism. He
believes one of the best ways to fight climate change is to encourage
dense urban development, and build the associated infrastructure
 to encourage people to live in walkable, bikable and transit rich 
places.  He is an avid hiker, frequenting California State Parks and
National Parks.
