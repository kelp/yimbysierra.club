# The YIMBY Party Slate for the Sierra Club San Francisco Group 2016 Executive Commitee Election.

## Armand Domalewski

Armand enjoys long walks on the beach, pina coladas, and
solving existential climate change. He's been obsessed with
environmentally friendly transit solutions since he was a small child,
nagging his parents to take him to BART stations so he could watch the
trains whiz by. He pursued this passion for environmental justice at
Novogradac and Company, working as an economic analyst specializing in
renewable energy tax credit policy. He published reports and analyses
advocating for expansions of critical funding sources for
environmentally sound forms of energy. He provided critical support at
New Media Ventures, a nonprofit that allocated funding to progressive
media and technology startups such as the Story of Stuff and the Daily
Kos. Armand's current work focuses on community organizing and housing
advocacy, with a major emphasis on the role of dense infill housing in
reducing carbon emissions.

## Travis Cole

Travis has been passionate about environmental, and conservation issues all
of his adult life, and has a strong interest in sustainable energy,
walkable cities, and urbanism. He believes we should be encouraging dense
urban development and car free lifestyles to improve the environment
and prevent global warming. San Francisco residents use less
electricity, less water, and drive fewer miles than the rest of
California and the rest of the United States. Because of this, we should
advocate for more housing development near jobs so people can give up
their cars and lower their carbon footprint. San Francisco can be the
model for sustainable urban development, and the Sierra Club can take
the lead in advocating for more housing where the environmental impact
is lowest. In dense cites like San Francisco.

Travis is an avid hiker, frequently enjoying our California State parks.
He grew up in rural Washington state, so is as much at home in nature as
in downtown San Francisco. Travis has had lifelong ties to the Bay Area.
His mother is a 3rd generation Bay Area native, who grew up in Half Moon
Bay and attended San Francisco State. 

Travis has worked in the technology industry for over 16 years,
and is currently an engineering lead at a well known technology company in 
San Francisco.

Travis rents an apartment in the Nob Hill neighborhood of San Francisco.

## Leigha Beckman

Leigha is extremely fortunate to call herself a lifelong resident of California 
and eight-year resident of the Bay Area. She is less fortunate, however, to 
witness the increasingly deleterious impacts of climate change resulting from
human activity. She strongly believes that it is our moral imperative and ecological 
duty to prevent and mitigate those impacts as much as possible.  

As an active urbanist advocate, she supports transit improvements that reduce vehicle 
miles traveled and their corresponding carbon emissions, such as expansion of Muni and 
Caltrain’s electrification project. She urged her San Francisco district supervisor to 
support Prop E, requiring the city to take responsibility of tree maintenance. At Tesla, 
she served as Program Manager for Environmental Health and Safety for service centers, 
where she worked to ensure global compliance with environmental regulations related to 
facilities, high voltage batteries, chemicals procurement, and several other operational 
areas. She worked closely with the Environmental Compliance and Sustainability team to 
launch a parts recycling efforts and manage end-of-life batteries, as well as other 
initiatives in line with Tesla’s green mission.

She is currently applying to law school with the intent to focus on land use and 
environmental law, and would be honored to serve on the Sierra Club’s Executive Committee.  

## Laura Foote Clark

Laura's father was an avid birdwatcher, and she grew up visiting marshes and
wild places up and down the East Coast. As a city-dweller and nerdy
child, she enjoyed spending weekends gathering pond scum and other samples
to check out under the microscope. She developed a deep appreciation for
nature preserves and the intricate ecosystems that rely upon them. She
witnessed first-hand the fragility of marshes and the destructive impact
of human activities along the Chesapeake Bay, picking up trash with
cleanup efforts.
 
As she grew older, she came to appreciate the role of urban planning in
preserving our wild places. As an environmentalist, she believes reducing
greenhouse gas emissions should be our number one objective. With that
comes reducing car usage and improving public transportation.
 
Having lived in Washington, DC, New York City, Chicago, and San
Francisco, she knows our city can do so much more to improve regional
public transportation in the Bay Area. We can do more to encourage
infill development and reduce suburban sprawl. We can reduce our
region’s carbon emissions dramatically with the right urban policies.
 
She has been a strong advocate for sustainable housing and transportation
in San Francisco. She hopes to continue that work with the San Francisco
Sierra Club.

Laura founded [GrowSF](http://www.growsanfrancisco.org/) and rents in San Francisco.
