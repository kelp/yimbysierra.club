The YIMBY Party is running a slate of candidates for the upcoming Sierra
Club San Francisco Group Executive Commitee election.

## Why? ##
As Urbanists, we see the Sierra Club as a potential ally. The
The Sierra Club's [Strategic
Plan](https://sierraclub.org/sites/www.sierraclub.org/files/Strategic-Plan-Overarching-Visionary-Goals.pdf)
has an explicit goal to "Promote environmentally sensitive
land use and urban design to minimize sprawl, provide a healthy
environment for all, and minimize resource use."

The San Francisco Bay Area Chapter rightly 
[calls out Contra Costa and
Marin
Counties](http://sierraclub.org/san-francisco-bay/blog/2016/08/problems-priority-development-areas-could-hamper-regions-ghg) 
for falling behind on meeting Plan Bay Area housing production in 
Priority Development Areas. We love to see this sort of thing from the
Sierra Club.

But unfortunately the San Francisco group continues to fight against
urban infil. Conor Johnston lays it all out in a recent 
[SF Examiner
OpEd](http://www.sfexaminer.com/sf-sierra-club-puts-politics-planet/)

It's clear something needs to change with the San Francisco Sierra Club
group. That is why we are running a slate of candidates for the Sierra
Club San Francisco Group Executive Commitee. There are 9 seats and 4 are
up for election this year.

Last year we ran a [similar
campaign](http://sfbarf.tumblr.com/post/130623182665/getting-the-local-san-francisco-chapter-of-the)
, and while none of our candidates won a seat, we raised awareness of
this issue, and help keep the local Sierra club true to their mission.
