The YIMBY Party is running a slate of candidates for the upcoming Sierra
Club San Francisco Group Executive Commitee election.

## Why? ##
As Urbanists, we see the Sierra Club as a potential ally. The Sierra Club's [Strategic
Plan](https://sierraclub.org/sites/www.sierraclub.org/files/Strategic-Plan-Overarching-Visionary-Goals.pdf)
has an explicit goal to "Promote environmentally sensitive
land use and urban design to minimize sprawl, provide a healthy
environment for all, and minimize resource use."

The Sierra Club San Francisco Bay Area _Chapter_ rightly 
[calls out Contra Costa and Marin
Counties](http://sierraclub.org/san-francisco-bay/blog/2016/08/problems-priority-development-areas-could-hamper-regions-ghg) 
for falling behind on meeting Plan Bay Area housing production in 
Priority Development Areas. That's a good thing.

However, the San Francisco _Group_ continues to fight against
urban infil. Conor Johnston lays it all out in a recent 
[SF Examiner
OpEd](http://www.sfexaminer.com/sf-sierra-club-puts-politics-planet/)

It's clear something needs to change with the San Francisco Sierra Club
Group. The local Group needs saving. That is why we are running a slate of candidates for the Sierra
Club San Francisco Group Executive Commitee. There are 9 seats and 4 are
up for election this year.

Last year we ran a [similar
campaign](http://sfbarf.tumblr.com/post/130623182665/getting-the-local-san-francisco-chapter-of-the). It didn't work, but we learned a lot. If you vote for us now, we'll win this year. We raised awareness of this issue, and helped keep the local Sierra club true to their mission.

## What? ##

To vote in the upcoming election you'll have to be a Sierra Club member
by October 31st, 2016, and you must live in San Francisco. 

Voting Opens November 11th.
